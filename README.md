🎈 Getting Started
Before we dive in, let’s gather our tools. PyReco needs a few libraries to function. You can find these in the requirements.txt file, just like a treasure map!

Installation Steps
Clone the Repository: Get your hands on the PyReco treasure!

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/happy2234/pyreco.git
cd pyreco
Install Requirements: Make sure you have all the goodies!

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Let’s Have Some Fun!
1. Register Faces
Ready to register some faces? Let’s start the adventure! Run the register_faces.py script:

bash
Copy code
python register_faces.py
Enter the name of the fabulous face you want to register.
Your webcam will spring to life, ready to capture the magic. Smile and strike a pose!
Press q to quit once you’ve gathered enough pictures (or whenever you’ve had enough fun).
2. Recognize Faces
Now for the real magic! Run the recognize_faces.py script:

bash
Copy code
python recognize_faces.py
Your webcam will be on a mission, scanning for familiar faces in real-time.
When it recognizes someone, it’ll display their name right on the screen! 🎉
3. Fine-Tune Your Experience
Feeling like a wizard? You can tweak some settings to make PyReco even better! Adjust parameters in the scripts to enhance recognition, such as:

The number of frames captured for registration.
The confidence threshold for recognizing faces.
🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips
Accuracy Issues: If it’s not recognizing faces, make sure the lighting is perfect, and the faces are clear.
Error Messages: Don’t panic! Just check the console for clues and ensure all dependencies are installed.
